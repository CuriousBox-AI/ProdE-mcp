# ProdE MCP Server

**[ProdE](https://prode.ai)** |**[Documentation](https://docs.prode.ai)** | **Free access to all ProdE features for first month**

*ProdE is your 24x7 available production engineer, a multi-repository AI coding assistant that understands your entire codebase ecosystem, not just individual files.*

## What is ProdE MCP Server?

ProdE MCP Server bridges the gap between your codebase and AI coding assistants by providing deep contextual understanding of your repositories. Instead of working with generic code suggestions, get AI responses that understand your specific project structure, patterns, and history across multiple codebases.
 
## Key Features

- **Cross-Repository Insights**: Query across multiple codebases simultaneously
- **Improved AI Accuracy**: AI understands your project structure and patterns
- **Contextual Code Understanding**: AI assistance based on your actual codebase, not generic examples
- **Secure Integration**: Token-based authentication with encrypted communication
- **Wide Tool Compatibility**: Supports 8+ popular coding assistants and editors

## Use Cases

### 1. **Multi-Repository Onboarding & System Understanding**
**Example**: A new developer joins your team and needs to understand how user authentication flows through your 15+ microservices across frontend, backend, and mobile repositories.

**What ProdE does**: Simultaneously analyzes authentication patterns across all repositories in your knowledge layer to provide a complete cross-service authentication flow explanation.

### 2. **Cross-Repository API Integration Discovery**
**Example**: You're building a feature that needs to integrate with internal APIs scattered across different team repositories, but documentation is outdated or missing.

**What ProdE does**: Searches across all connected repositories to find current API definitions, real usage examples, and integration patterns from multiple services in one query.

### 3. **Multi-Repo Impact Analysis for Refactoring**
**Example**: You need to refactor a shared utility library used across 20+ repositories, but want to understand all usage patterns and potential breaking changes.

**What ProdE does**: Analyzes usage patterns across all repositories simultaneously to identify every implementation, dependency, and similar code that could be affected by your changes.

### 4. **Distributed System Bug Investigation**
**Example**: A production issue involves data flow through multiple services (payment-service, user-service, notification-service, audit-service), and you need to trace the complete request lifecycle.

**What ProdE does**: Connects the dots between all involved repositories to map the complete data flow, error handling, and logging patterns across your entire distributed system.

### 5. **Cross-Project Architecture Pattern Analysis**
**Example**: You're implementing caching for a new service and want to see what caching strategies, configurations, and patterns your team has successfully used across different projects.

**What ProdE does**: Analyzes caching implementations across all repositories in your knowledge layer to show proven patterns, configuration examples, and architectural decisions from your entire codebase ecosystem.

## Available Tools

The ProdE MCP server provides the following tools:

- `get_all_repositories` - Retrieve information about all repositories in your knowledge layer
- `ask_specific_codebase` - Ask questions about a specific repository/codebase
- `ask_all_codebases` - Ask questions across all your repositories
